# Product Requirements Document (PRD) – Segment & Vintage Level Forecasting (V1 Focused Scope)

## 1. Objective
Estimate monthly hazard rates (payment and charge-off) from a provided training dataset with varying loan maturities. Use these estimates to forecast the remaining curve for a specific vintage/segment, outputting results in a simple tabular format for validation and understanding.

## 2. Stakeholders
- Portfolio Analytics
- Data Science

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1. Data Requirements
- **Input:** Training dataset with loan-level or aggregated segment/vintage data, including:
  - Loan age/month
  - Principal outstanding
  - Principal payments
  - Principal charge-offs
- **Right-censoring:** Training data may be right-censored (loans still active).

### 3.2. Functional Requirements
- Estimate monthly hazard rates (payment %, charge-off %) from the training data.
- Allow user to input actuals for a specific vintage/segment up to a given month.
- Forecast the remaining curve (payments, charge-offs, balances) for that vintage/segment using estimated hazard rates.
- Output results in a simple columnar/table format (e.g., CSV, DataFrame).

### 3.3. Non-Functional Requirements
- Model and outputs must be transparent and easy to interpret.
- No dashboarding or advanced reporting in V1.
- Code should be modular to allow future enhancements.

### 3.4. Reporting
- Output a table with columns such as:
  - Month
  - Starting Principal
  - Payment Amount
  - Charge-off Amount
  - Ending Principal

### 3.5. Validation
- Compare model outputs to actuals for the provided vintage/segment.
- Allow for visual/manual inspection of the output table.

## 4. Milestones
- Data ingestion and cleaning
- Hazard rate estimation from training data
- Forecasting for a single vintage/segment
- Output to columnar/table format

## 5. Risks & Mitigations
- Small sample sizes in training data → Aggregate as needed, document uncertainty.
- Model may not generalize to all vintages/segments → Validate with holdout samples.

## V1 Project Structure

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Ingest and clean training dataset.
   - Structure data by month of age for each segment/vintage.

2. **Hazard Rate Estimation**
   - Estimate monthly payment and charge-off rates using survival/hazard modeling or simple empirical rates.

3. **Forecasting**
   - For a selected vintage/segment, use actuals up to a given month.
   - Apply estimated hazard rates to forecast future months.

4. **Output**
   - Produce a simple table with monthly projections for principal, payments, charge-offs, and balances.
