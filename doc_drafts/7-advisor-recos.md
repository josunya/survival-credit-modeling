# Business Strategy Review and Recommendations for Survival Credit Modeling

## Executive Summary

After reviewing the project documentation and implementation, I've identified several critical concerns from a business perspective. While the technical approach shows promise, there are significant risks of over-engineering, scope creep, and losing sight of core business objectives. My recommendations focus on dramatically simplifying the approach, establishing clear success metrics, and ensuring business value delivery before adding complexity.

## Key Findings

### 1. **Excessive Complexity for Initial Phase**
- The 4-phase PRD proposes sophisticated statistical methods (Kaplan-Meier, Cox models) too early
- Phase 1 implementation already includes 5 separate classes with complex validation
- Business users will struggle to understand and trust the methodology

### 2. **Unclear Business Value Proposition**
- No clear ROI calculations or business case presented
- Success metrics focus on technical accuracy rather than business outcomes
- Missing cost-benefit analysis for each phase

### 3. **Feature Creep Risk**
- PRD includes advanced features (ML, real-time monitoring) without proving basic value
- Multiple alternative methods proposed without clear selection criteria
- Risk of building a "Swiss Army knife" instead of a focused tool

### 4. **Explainability Concerns**
- Despite claims of transparency, the implementation is already technically dense
- Hazard rates and survival functions are not intuitive business concepts
- Output format (ratios, hazard rates) requires transformation for business use

## Priority Recommendations

### HIGH PRIORITY

1. **Start with Excel-Based Proof of Concept**
   - Build initial model in Excel to ensure business understanding
   - Use simple averages and trend lines before any statistical methods
   - Prove value with 1-2 pilot segments before any coding

2. **Redefine Success Metrics**
   - Replace technical metrics (MAPE, RMSE) with business outcomes
   - Examples: "Reduce forecast variance by $X", "Enable Y% better capital allocation"
   - Tie directly to revenue impact or cost savings

3. **Simplify Phase 1 Dramatically**
   - Remove all statistical terminology from business communications
   - Use only moving averages or simple decay curves
   - Output in dollar terms, not ratios or rates

4. **Establish Clear Go/No-Go Gates**
   - Define specific business value thresholds for proceeding to next phase
   - Example: "Must demonstrate $500K+ annual value before Phase 2"
   - Include stakeholder satisfaction scores, not just accuracy

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

5. **Create Business-First Documentation**
   - Replace technical PRD with 2-page business case
   - Use analogies and examples familiar to credit teams
   - Focus on "what decisions will this enable?" not "how it works"

6. **Implement Minimal Viable Product (MVP)**
   - Single Python script (<200 lines) for Phase 1
   - No classes, minimal dependencies
   - Focus on one specific use case with measurable impact

7. **Defer Advanced Features**
   - Remove Phases 3-4 from current planning
   - Revisit only after Phase 1-2 demonstrate clear value
   - Consider whether simpler tools might suffice permanently

### LOW PRIORITY

8. **Simplify Data Requirements**
   - Start with aggregated monthly summaries, not loan-level data
   - Use existing reports if possible
   - Minimize IT involvement in Phase 1

9. **Focus Communication on Outcomes**
   - Replace "survival modeling" with "payment forecasting"
   - Use business language: "predict cash flows" not "estimate hazard rates"
   - Create one-page visual summaries for executives

## Specific Concerns About Current Approach

### Technical Over-Engineering
- The current Python implementation with 5+ classes is unnecessarily complex
- Business users cannot validate or modify the logic
- High maintenance burden for limited initial value

### Methodology Confusion
- Three different "simple" methods proposed, creating analysis paralysis
- No clear criteria for choosing between approaches
- Risk of endless experimentation without business value delivery

### Timeline and Resource Concerns
- 12-month timeline is excessive for unproven value
- Full-time data scientist for Phase 1 is overkill
- Should achieve initial results in 4-6 weeks, not 3 months

## Recommended Simplified Approach

### Week 1-2: Business Case Development
- Interview 5 key stakeholders on current pain points
- Quantify cost of current forecast errors
- Define 3 specific decisions the tool will improve

### Week 3-4: Excel Prototype
- Build simple model using historical averages
- Test on 2-3 segments with known outcomes
- Present results to stakeholders for feedback

### Week 5-6: Python MVP (if Excel proves value)
- Single script implementing chosen method
- Basic CSV input/output
- Side-by-side comparison with current methods

### Week 7-8: Pilot and Measurement
- Run parallel with existing process for 1 month
- Measure actual business impact
- Go/no-go decision on expansion

## Questions to Answer Before Proceeding

1. What specific business decisions will this tool improve?
2. What is the dollar value of better forecasts?
3. Can we achieve 80% of the value with 20% of the complexity?
4. Do stakeholders understand and trust the methodology?
5. Is there a simpler commercial solution available?

## Conclusion

The current approach shows classic signs of technical teams solving for elegance rather than business value. By dramatically simplifying the initial approach, focusing on proven value, and maintaining laser focus on business outcomes, this project can deliver real value quickly. The sophisticated methods can wait until basic value is proven and stakeholders are demanding more accuracy.

Remember: The best model is not the most accurate one, but the one that gets used and improves business decisions. Start simple, prove value, then gradually add sophistication only where it demonstrably improves outcomes.
