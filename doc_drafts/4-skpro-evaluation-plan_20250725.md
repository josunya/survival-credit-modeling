# Analysis: skpro Package Fit for Survival Credit Modeling

## Executive Assessment: **STRONG TECHNICAL FIT** with implementation considerations

**Key Strengths:**
- **Direct survival modeling support**: skpro explicitly handles "tabular probabilistic time-to-event and survival prediction" - exactly what your PRD requires
- **Probabilistic forecasting**: Provides interval, quantile, and full distribution predictions (critical for your confidence interval requirements)
- **Individual-level modeling**: Supports "instance-individual survival distributions" for loan-level analysis
- **Validation framework**: Built-in probabilistic metrics (CRPS, pinball loss) align with your statistical validation needs

**Implementation Considerations:**

**Phase 1 (Foundation)**: 
- **Potential overfit**: skpro may be too sophisticated for initial "simple empirical methods" goal
- **Stakeholder buy-in**: Need to verify explainability for business users
- **Recommendation**: Start with simple empirical rates, plan skpro integration for Phase 2

**Phase 2-4 (Enhanced/Advanced)**: 
- **Excellent fit**: Probabilistic modeling, advanced methods, ML integration
- **Need verification**: Confirm support for specific methods (Kaplan-Meier, Cox proportional hazards)
- **Custom development required**: Batch segment processing, business logic (payment/charge-off calculations)

**Technical Implementation Plan:**
1. **Evaluation Phase**: Build proof-of-concept with sample data
2. **Integration Strategy**: Layer skpro capabilities with custom business logic
3. **Validation Framework**: Leverage skpro's probabilistic metrics alongside business metrics
4. **Production Readiness**: Assess maturity for financial applications

**Recommendation**: **Proceed with skpro** as core modeling engine for Phases 2-4, with custom wrapper for business requirements and segment processing automation.
