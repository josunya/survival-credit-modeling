# Business Advisor Recommendations: Survival Credit Modeling Tool
## URGENT: From Zero to Automated Forecasting in 1 Week

**Date:** July 26, 2025  
**Prepared by:** Business Systems Advisor  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Current manual processes causing operational risk

---

## Executive Summary: The Burning Platform

**Current State:** ZERO automated loan forecasting. Every forecast is a manual fire drill with:
- Inconsistent methodologies between quarters
- Unstable input data leading to garbage outputs  
- Analyst team under unnecessary stress
- Ad-hoc requests consuming indefinite time
- No trusted loan-level outputs for external stakeholders

**Business Impact:**
- Rating agencies questioning methodology inconsistencies
- Securitization pricing discussions lack credible forecasts
- Ownership requires manual explanations for every variance
- ~8 team members need basic understanding but have no standardized tool

**The Ask:** Build ANYTHING automated in 1-2 days, full prototype in 1 week. Perfect is the enemy of done.

## Revised Recommendation: Sprint to MVP

### Forget the 12-Month Plan - Here's What We Need NOW

**Day 1-2: Basic Automation** (48 hours)
1. Single segment Excel/CSV ingestion
2. Historical balance paydown visualization  
3. Basic forecast extension of recent trends
4. Export to Excel with clear assumptions

**Day 3-7: Minimum Viable Prototype** (1 week)
1. Add charge-off curve forecasting
2. Implement actual-to-forecast blending
3. Create comparison to lifetime expectations
4. Basic PowerBI dashboard template

**Week 2-4: Make It Stick**
1. Document the process so others can run it
2. Add 2-3 more segments
3. Create standard monthly process
4. Train the team of 8

## Technical Approach: Radical Simplification

### Use What You Have
- **Python:** Simple pandas scripts, no fancy libraries
- **SQL:** Direct data pulls, minimal transformation
- **Excel:** Output format everyone understands
- **PowerBI:** Basic visualizations, not complex models

### Core Requirements (Your Own Words)
1. Forecast one segment at a time
2. View historical performance curves
3. See input values transparently
4. Blend actuals to forecast smoothly
5. Compare to lifetime expectations (e.g., 20% CO at month 144 → expected at month 18)

### What to Build First
```
Input: segment_data.csv
- Month, Principal, Payments, Chargeoffs

Process: 
1. Calculate historical rates
2. Project forward using recent average
3. Blend with lifetime expectations

Output: forecast_output.xlsx
- Historical + Forecast curves
- Input assumptions visible
- Variance to expectations
```

## Implementation Reality Check

### Your Constraints = Your Design
- **Developer:** 1 person (you)
- **Users:** Chief Credit Officer, Head of Credit, Analysts
- **Timeline:** 1-2 days initial, 1 week prototype
- **Success Criteria:** ANY automated forecast beats manual chaos

### Day-by-Day Sprint Plan

**Monday (Day 1):**
- Morning: Set up Python script for data ingestion
- Afternoon: Calculate historical rates, create basic charts
- EOD: Show CCO a single segment forecast

**Tuesday (Day 2):**
- Morning: Add forecast projection logic
- Afternoon: Create Excel output template
- EOD: Deliver first automated forecast

**Wednesday-Friday (Days 3-5):**
- Add charge-off curves
- Implement blending logic
- Create PowerBI template
- Test with 2-3 segments

**Following Week:**
- Documentation and training
- Expand to more segments
- Establish monthly process

## Risk Mitigation: What Could Go Wrong?

### Technical Risks → Simple Solutions
- **Data quality issues** → Flag anomalies, don't try to fix
- **Forecast unreasonable** → Cap at historical min/max
- **Users don't understand** → Over-communicate assumptions

### Business Risks → Clear Boundaries  
- **Scope creep** → "Version 1 does X. Period."
- **Methodology debates** → "We'll refine after we automate"
- **Perfect expectations** → "Better than manual is the bar"

## Success Metrics: Keep It Simple

### Week 1 Success
✓ One segment forecasted automatically  
✓ CCO can explain the output
✓ Results match manual "reasonableness" test
✓ Process documented

### Month 1 Success  
✓ 5+ segments automated
✓ Monthly process established
✓ Team of 8 trained on basics
✓ No more quarterly fire drills

### Month 3 Success
✓ All major segments included
✓ PowerBI dashboards in use
✓ Methodology documented for auditors
✓ Team focusing on insights, not mechanics

## The Bottom Line

You're not building a Ferrari - you're replacing a broken bicycle. The current state of ZERO automation means:

1. **Any code > No code**
2. **Simple forecasts > No forecasts**  
3. **Transparent logic > Perfect models**
4. **1 week delivery > 12 month plan**

**Next Step:** Start coding. Today. Right now. One segment, basic logic, Excel output. Everything else can wait.

## Addendum: What NOT to Do

### Avoid These Traps
- ❌ Researching survival analysis packages
- ❌ Building elaborate validation frameworks
- ❌ Creating perfect documentation upfront
- ❌ Designing for 100 segments when you need 1
- ❌ Waiting for clean data (it won't happen)

### Focus On This
- ✅ Working code by end of day
- ✅ Visual output CCO can understand
- ✅ Simple logic you can explain
- ✅ Automated > Manual (always)
- ✅ Iterate after you ship

**Remember:** Your competition isn't other forecasting tools - it's the current chaos of manual Excel fire drills. You win by shipping something that works TODAY.
